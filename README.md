# OpenGL Mapfall
 
Mapfall is an educational game made with OpenGL. It plays like a Fall Guys map in which you need to stand on the correct country or you fall and lose the game. First OpenGL game but genuinely educational! Taught me the European map.

Made for TCD Comp Sci MSc module Computer Graphics.
